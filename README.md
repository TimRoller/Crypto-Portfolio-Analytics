# Crypto-Portfolio-Analytics

Given a list of cryptocurrencies over a defined time period, calculate the 
total return, sharpe ratio, sortino ratio, max drawdown, and calmar ratio.
  
Note the performance of each cryptocurrency vs. an equally weighted portfolio. The portfolio provides a return similar to the top 
performers without nearly as much risk of a drawdown.
