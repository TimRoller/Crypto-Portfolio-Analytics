# Crypto-Portfolio-Analytics

Given a list of cryptocurrencies over a defined time period, calculate the total return, sharpe ratio, sortino ratio, max drawdown, and calmar ratio.
  
Compare the return of each cryptocurrency vs. an equally weighted portfolio. 
The portfolio provides a return similar to the top performers, but without nearly as much risk of a drawdown.
